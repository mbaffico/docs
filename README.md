# 📁 GitHub Pages: Hosted Visualizations & Analyses

Welcome to my documentation site for hosted HTML outputs and data-driven insights. This repository serves as a centralized location for interactive reports, visualizations, and case studies developed in R and other tools.

🧰 Contents:
- Exploratory analyses across geographic and sports performance datasets
- Visual storytelling using `ggplot2`, `leaflet`, and other R packages
- Predictive modeling experiments and statistical diagnostics
- Technical notes and reproducible workflows

📌 This repository evolves—new projects and updates will be added over time. Each folder contains its own README for context where applicable.

Let me know if you'd like to collaborate or explore an analysis in more detail!
